Welcome to Athora. Athora is a strategy based puzzle game designed to be played in the command line, inspired by classic MS-DOS game Zork. Developed by @Nulfy (Dev Kapadia) for SDD Term 1 Assignment.

# Story
In Athora's default map "The Wrath of Felon", you play through the perspective of an agent in a near distant future, where multi-billionaire businessman Felon Muks (CEO of Tesca, The Interesting Company and SpaceF) has strengthened his iron grip on a failing humanity and a shortage of magenta ink. A secret organisation led by rebellious hackers hired you to save Earth. They eagerly watch as the fate of life unfolds beneath your fingers...
